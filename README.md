- 👋 Hi, I’m @fernandoaestrella
- 👀 I’m interested in achieving permanent, acute and unflickering happiness and in crushing limitations, specially the ones that pinch me most frequently like the ones that stem from feeling separate from others or from improperly managing my energies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity, playfulness, the power of attention, and letting go.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Unity!
- 📫 Reach me at fernandoaestrella+curiosity@gmail.com. I sometimes post some writings at https://thought-dr.blogspot.com/
